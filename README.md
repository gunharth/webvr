# WCIS VR Demo

<br>This is a simple demonstration of how easy it is to build virtual reality presentations using A-Frame.</b>
<br>We decided to set up a simple showroom where you can wander around either by using your WASD keys on the keyboard or by touching your screen if you are using a smartphone.</br>
